Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at Michigan State University. My work consist in using statistical methods to study population genetics in a spatial context.

I did my PhD in population genetics at University of Bern, where I did my thesis on rapid adaptation in the presence of gene flow.

I studied theoretical physics University of Geneva, before completley switching topic and falling in love with evolutionary biology. It was a challenge to move from one field to the other, but it was worth it, and I never lose the opportunity to try and convince other physicists to do the sameâ€¦
