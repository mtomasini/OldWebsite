Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at Michigan State University. In my work, I use statistical methods to study population genetics in a spatial context. The ultimate goal is to use such methods to infer population parameters (density, dispersal rate, etc.) from patterns of genetic diversity.

I did my PhD in population genetics at University of Bern, where I did my thesis on rapid adaptation in the presence of gene flow.

I studied theoretical physics at University of Geneva, before completley switching topic and falling in love with evolutionary biology. It was a challenge to move from one field to the other, but it was worth it, and I never lose the opportunity to try and convince other physicists to do the sameâ€¦
