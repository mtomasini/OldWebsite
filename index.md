"[...] _ils se moquaient souvent de ce que je voulais le savoir_ [...]. _Mais, malgré ce désespoir, je ne laisse pas de désirer d'être instruit, et ma curiosité trompée est toujours insatiable_."
Voltaire, Le philosophe ignorant. [^1]

Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at the University of Gothenburg. In my work, I use mathematical modelling, simulations, and statistical methods to study population genetics in a spatial context. The ultimate goal is to use such methods to understand the influence of spatio-temporal factors on the evolution of genetic patterns.

I did my PhD in population genetics at University of Bern, where I completed my thesis on rapid adaptation in the presence of gene flow.

I studied theoretical physics at University of Geneva, before completely switching topic and falling in love with evolutionary biology. It was a challenge to move from one field to the other, but it was worth it, and I never lose the opportunity to try and convince other physicists to do the same…

[^1]: Tr: "[...] they often made fun of what I wanted to know [...]. But, despite this desperation, I never tire of desiring of being instructed, and my unsatisfied curiosity is always insatiable."
