Currently, I’m doing a postdoc in the [Bradburd Lab](http://www.genescape.org/) at Michigan State University. I am interested in how genetic patterns -- such as neutral genetic diversity -- evolve in space and time. While most of population genetics has been focusing on models of discrete space, species often evolve in continuous space. However, most models of evolution in continuous space have so far been limited to very specific cases or are not relevant for real biological scenarios. In my work, I try on one hand to understand how continuous space could be correctly introduced in our models, and on the other hand how we can still approximate continuous space as being discrete when dealing with genetic data analysis.

I did my PhD at the University of Bern, working in the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and the [Computational and Molecular Population Genetics](https://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) lab, under the supervision of [Dr. Stephan Peischl](http://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_peischl_stephan/index_eng.html) and [Prof. Laurent Excoffier](https://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/about_us/team/researchers/prof_dr_excoffier_laurent/index_eng.html). My research there focused on processes of fast adaptation in a spatially explicit context, in particular in populations facing harsh environmental changes. In such situation, the establishment of new mutations is an important aspect in preventing extinction. The survival of an endangered population following the establishment of a beneficial mutation takes the name of “evolutionary rescue”.

Other research topics that tickle my curiosity include in general the study of spatial patterns in evolution and the understanding of patterns of genetic variation. I also have a great interest in anything related to our species, from the study of ancient genomes to the evolution of social norms.

I have a keen interest in the technical side of population genetics: that is why in my research I always take time to develop the right tools to study different biological problems. In particular, these tools can be software, algorithms or mathematical and statistical models. This interest unites with the pledge for reproducible science: too often, researchers in our field publish scripts pertaining to a new method that cannot readily be tested and reproduced by other scientists. This is due to a lack of good practices in programming, and also the lack of resources to produce and maintain an open source software. I think that we should enter a new paradigm where we give equal recognition to people who invent new methods and people who create new softwares. As a community, we should also create resources for open source software. 

I am also passionate about teaching: it is the duty of any person with knowledge to try and pass it to other people, and in particular to the new generations. That is why I am always happy to pursue projects of scientific dissemination.

In my free time I like to do sports and to play music. Furthermore, I enjoy studying the art of magic (intended as illusion, not as dark magic); in the words of Spanish magician Miguel Angel Gea, "magic is the emotional disequilibrium of someone who doubts our existence; of someone who tells you that laws of nature are just hearsay, someone who will show you for a moment another possible world". I could hardly find a more fitting description to describe Science, too.
