[Here](../docs/CV.pdf) you can find my CV.

Currently, I’m doing a postdoc in the [Bradburd Lab](http://www.genescape.org/) at Michigan State University. I work on methods to infer population parameters from patterns of isolation by distance.

I did my PhD at the University of Bern, working in the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](http://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and the [Computational and Molecular Population Genetics](http://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) lab, under the supervision of [Dr. Stephan Peischl](http://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_peischl_stephan/index_eng.html). My research there focused on processes of fast adaptation in a spatially explicit context, in particular in populations facing harsh environmental changes. In such situation, the establishment of new mutations is an important aspect in preventing extinction. The survival of an endangered population following the establishment of a beneficial mutation takes the name of “evolutionary rescue”.

Other research topics that tickle my curiosity include in general the study of spatial patterns in evolution and the understanding of patterns of genetic variation. I also have a great interest in anything related to our species, from the study of ancient genomes to the evolution of social norms.

I have a keen interest in the technical side of population genetics: that is why in my research I always take time to develop the right tools to study different biological problems. In particular, these tools can be software, algorithms or mathematical and statistical models.

I am also passionate about teaching: it is the duty of any person with knowledge to try and pass it to other people, and in particular to the new generations. That is why I am always happy to pursue projects of scientific dissemination.

In my free time I like to do sports and to play music.
